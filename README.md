# AListOfTikToksAboutReadingPeopleLikeABook-WhatTheyreReallyAllAbout-BeingStreetSmart

ill add throughout the month, the ones ive seen and other ones, its all important stuff, its not found really in books its ppls experiences, u have to know this stuff, be really good at it. my sil is an attorney, she operates so differently from my brother who is a programmer, i want to be more like her

u will keep meeting ppl like those penn losers, bc of me. not all the time, but, there are MEN out there and their only purpose is to prove to everyone that theyre smarter than me, a WOMAN. its a different world for me

and then there are people who are phenomenal talkers/speakers, like amazing, (bc u can learn how to become a better talker, right) but theyre not that smart, they may have some skills and they can cause a lot of damage bc u can trust them with ur work, and its like, thats not a good person to trust, they dunno what theyre doing
