# AListOfTikToksAboutReadingPeopleLikeABook-WhatTheyreReallyAllAbout-BeingStreetSmart

ill add throughout the month, the ones ive seen and other ones, its all important stuff, its not found really in books its ppls experiences, u have to know this stuff, be really good at it. my sil is an attorney, she operates so differently from my brother who is a programmer, i want to be more like her

u will keep meeting ppl like those penn losers, bc of me. not all the time, but, there are MEN out there and their only purpose is to prove to everyone that theyre smarter than me, a WOMAN. its a different world for me

and then there are people who are phenomenal talkers/speakers, like amazing, (bc u can learn how to become a better talker, right) but theyre not that smart, they may have some skills and they can cause a lot of damage bc u can trust them with ur work, and its like, thats not a good person to trust, they dunno what theyre doing

my sil will read a news article and ill have read the same news article. so she picks out the law or case relevant to that story and how nyc operates legally (bc shes an attorney in nyc), and for me, its like ill read the story, and ill get it and ill understand it, connect it to things i know. but thats the thing with chatgpt, u can ask it, to pick out things that u may have missed, or may not think are imporant, things like that. im not saying ure a passive person, but dont be a passive person, question everything.
